    <span class="h3">What is an epitaph?</span>
    <p>An epitaph refers to text that is inscribed on a tombstone. Many of the
    best epitaphs are very short, such as one or two lines. While there is no
    specific format for the
    information that must be included, keeping the epitaph short
    challenges the writer to sum up your life.</p>
    <p>Tailor the emotion of the epitaph to what you want to be remembered
    by. Epitaphs may be humorous, ironic, or heartfelt. Whatever its
    emotional mode, itâ€™ll be your last words.</p>
